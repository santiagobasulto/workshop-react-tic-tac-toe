# React Seed

Simple seed project to kick off a minimal ES6+React project with Webpack and Babel. No redux, no GraphQL, nothing but plain old React.

You'll want to clone this repo and re-initialize its git history:

    $ git clone && cd $_
    $ rm -Rf .git

You probably also want to add your own info in `package.json`.

## Setup and installation

    $ npm install -d

## Usage

    $ # Start webpack dev server
    $ npm start

Now point your browser to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)
